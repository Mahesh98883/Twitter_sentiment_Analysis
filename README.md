Sentiment Analysis Project

Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text. The primary objective is to classify text sentiment into three categories:

Positive

Negative

Neutral

By analyzing textual data, specifically tweets, this project aims to provide meaningful insights into public opinion and sentiment trends.

Features

Text Sentiment Classification: Categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using NLP techniques.

Tweet Analysis: Processes real-world tweets to evaluate the sentiment expressed.

Data Processing & Cleaning: Uses Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas to efficiently handle, clean, and analyze data.

Machine Learning & NLP Integration: Employs NLP methodologies for feature extraction and sentiment prediction.

Efficient Data Analysis: Utilizes Python-based data manipulation tools to optimize performance and accuracy.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for the project.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applied for text preprocessing and sentiment classification.

NumPy & Pandas: Used for efficient data handling, transformation, and analysis.

NLTK / spaCy: For text tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

Scikit-learn: Utilized for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

Implementation Details

Data Collection:

Extracted tweets using API or dataset containing textual data.

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words.

Stop-word Removal: Eliminating common words that do not impact sentiment.

Stemming & Lemmatization: Converting words to their root forms.

Feature Extraction:

Employed TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to represent text numerically.

Model Training:

Trained a classification model using supervised learning algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest.

Sentiment Prediction:

Classified new text inputs into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Performance Evaluation:

Assessed model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Future Enhancements

Integration with real-time Twitter API for live sentiment analysis.

Implementation of deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers for improved accuracy.

Deployment as a web application for user-friendly interaction.
